INFRA - Infrastructure Committee Report - Summit 2014
-----------------------------------------------------


DRAFT VERSION


Chair: Not determined

Committee Description: Define an architecture, select tools, maintain the site. Implement business requirements given to you by the other sub-committees. Live Showcase idea. DNS and Mailing List administration.

Progress on the actions:

* Define an architecture

    No decisions on architecture have been taken yet, although MC has been working on a
    puppet/vagrant based system for creating a distribution for the DISTRO committee, and 
    this has dual functionality for deploying/provisioning the distribution, so therefore
    it is quite likely that we will drink our own nectar and attempt to use this 
    distribution (or dev versions of it) to provide our own alfresco instances.

    MC is currently running a small test vm which could be used to provide a small instance
    of Alfresco, currently it is based on Ubuntu 14.04.

    We might alternatively seek to attain a sponsored platform from one of the companies
    which has members with the Order

* Select tools

    Mailman was chosen for mailing lists, although prior to this we started to use github
    issues for this purpose. TO BE DISCUSSED: MC considers that mailing lists with published
    archives should replace the github issues for committee discussions.

    DNS is held at Cloudflare 

* Maintain the site

    Maintenance of the site was delegated to the github website hosting capabilities

* Implement business requirements

    None received yet

* Live showcase idea

    Not discussed or implemented yet.

* DNS administration

    DNS is currently delegated to Cloudflare, however this is currently under MC's personal
    cloudflare account and we should move it to an account controlled by this committee

* Mailing list administration

    This has been provided by Xtreamlab.net - MC has admin permission to create and maintain
    mailing lists. MC will ask Xtreamlab if it is possible to share these credentials with
    the INFRA committee and does not expect any problem with that.
